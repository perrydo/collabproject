                    <!-- <p class="lead">Well... There really isn't any maintenance...</p> -->
                    <p class="mb-2">An AGOL & Survey123 Maintenance Guide was created and provided to the client to safeguard successful long term operation. Although this project was created so that it requires minimal maintenance, all software requires maintenance eventually. There may come a time when the client needs to change something on the website, the surveys or the maps, and they won't have the skills necessary to do so, since the client does not have any GIS or technical knowledge to make any changes on their own, For this reason, we have recommended that they seek out other IT services in advance, because they may need time to find someone with the necessary skills who has low enough prices for them, or even volunteer their services.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">Because the project is dependent on the client having access to an ArcGIS account, and right now their account is dependent on them being a student at Fleming, this isn't a sustainable long-term solution. We recommend that the client look into fundraising enough to pay for their own ESRI account and any IT services they may need.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">While they have access to the student account, it is recommended that they take notes about which parts of the project work well, and which parts could use some modifications to better suit their evolving needs. Developing an organizational system to keep track of these changes will minimize IT costs and ensure that they get the results that they are looking for when they make changes.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">Finally, the client can use some of the information discovered during the spatial analyses to inform future decisions. Because they have emphasized that they want to take into consideration the needs of their new First Nations partners, they can look at how there aren't many food sources in the Treaty 20 lands outside of the Kawartha area, or they can look at the population density map and reach out to existing charities in low-service areas.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">This project is part of an ongoing effort to help reduce the amount of food poverty in Ontario, and is an example of how GIS technology can be applied to solve a variety of problems. This project will hopefully inspire other regions to take advantage of underutilized resources as well. </p>
